Notebook
---------

1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset  
	- CIC-IDS 2017
3. Data Processing
	- Removing Duplicate Data
	- Drop Cleaning  
4. Data Visualization
5. Label Encoder 
	- Converting the Str to Int
6. Feature Selection
	- Lasso
7. Oversampling
	- SMOTE
8. Splitting the dataset in train and validation 
9. Building the model 

	- With and Without Hyperparameter
		- XGBoost
		- LightGBM
		- CATBoost
		- Random Forest 
		- DecisionTree
		- RF + DT
	- Voting Classifier - (Bagging with RF + ET)

11. Training and Building the model
12. Comparing the models with accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score,  
13. Comparison graphs are generated with scores of all models.





FrontEnd
--------

14. Frontend is developed with help of Flask Framework, along with Registration and Login setup with support of Sqlite DB
15. For the frontend we used the data for predicting the Intrusion Attack Detection 
16. User gives input as Feature Values 
17. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
18. Trained model is used for prediction
19. Final outcome is displayed through frontend


Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentioned to use  Lasso FS and SMOTE oversampling the data and analysis with ML models, and ensemble model of RF + DT, 
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction. 
However, we can further enhance the performance by ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier  and got 100% of accuracy
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
